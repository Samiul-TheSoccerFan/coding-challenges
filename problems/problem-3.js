/**
 1. Given an array of integers nums, return the number of good pairs. A pair (i, j) is called good if nums[i] == nums[j] and i < j.
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,1,3]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: There are 4 good pairs (0,3), (0,4), (3,4), (2,5) 0-indexed.

    Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: Each pair in the array are good.

    Input: nums = [1,2,3]
    Output: 0

 2. Given a number, write a function to calculate the sum of the digits.
    arr = 123
    output = 6; 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
 3. Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one. 
    Assume only one will appear once.

    nums = [2,2,1]
    output: 1

    nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
    Output: 4

    nums = [1]
    Output: 1
 4. Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be unique and you may return the result in any order.

    Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
    Output: [2]

    Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
    Output: [9,4]
    Explanation: [4,9] is also accepted.
