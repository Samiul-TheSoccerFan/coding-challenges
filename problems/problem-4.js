/**
Let's build a guessing game preferably in React. Generate a random number and take input from user using an input field and show a label below:

- Guessed right; If the input and generated random matches.
- Too low; If the guessed number is lower than the generated random number.
- Too high; If the guessed number is higher than the generated random number.

Keep the count of the number of guesses.

Note: if you want to skip React and want to do with only JS, that is also good too.
